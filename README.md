n: length of the vector, always a power of 2	[depends on vector input]
p: prime number of the form kn + 1		[chosen]
k: positive integer				[chosen, but depends on prime]
r: primitive root of the prime p		[calculated]

e.g.,

vec 	= [v0,v1,v2,v3]
n 	= 4
p	= 5
k 	= 2

r	= 2

if my understanding holds, this should now work up to 63 bit primes
